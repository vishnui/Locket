# Locket-Android
The safest wallet around.  Our $20,000 hack from Money 20/20.
An app that connects to a small bluetooth chip you can put in your wallet.  As soon as your wallet leaves a ten foot radius around you, the app will alert you.  You can then track it down by having it play a sound or if you can't find it, cancel all your cards so whoever finds it cannot use them.  Makes your wallet safer.
